# Front-End-Learning
A repository that contains various front-end learning projects. This serves as a space where I can keep common UI patterns and templates which I can re-use and modify in the future.

Many of these examples are mirrored on codepen. Links will be provided as they exist.

## Some notes on formatting:

* **File & folder naming conventions:**
Use underscores "_" between file names. Since the GitHub repository name forces *kebab-style* for the repository root folder. All sub folders will follow underscore style. File names will use underscores across all types.

* **Variable names:** will use camelCase.
* **Functions:** will use camelCase.
* **CSS class rules:** will use kebab-case.
* **SASS variables:** will use kebab-case.
* **HTML id's:** will use camelCase.
* **Image names:** will use underscore case.

## Pricing Grid Template:
A basic pricing grid based on the flexbox layout engine.
* The file **pricing_grid_template.html** contains a single product option in the pricing grid. A pricing grid can have many product options.
* The file **pricing_grid_preview.html** will show what many product options looks like in the browser.

## Random Color Background Event:
A JavaScript that attached a click event to a `100vh` (view height) body element
and generates a psuedorandom hexadecimal color before setting it to the body.

## User Registration Page
A basic user registration page with form inputs that dislay submitted information.

## Hour Based Countdown Timer App

## Addition Evaluator
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this small UI example is something that could be
used in educational web software to solve math problems.

## Horizontal Navs
Examples of some common horizontal navigation UI components for the web.

## Switching Images Using JS
A basic script that switches two images based on a given condition.

## TODO List - Implemented Using a Vanilla Web Development Stack
Using only pure JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 to create the front end of a TODO list app.
* The directory and file structure follows that all files are in the subdirectory `/todo_vanilla`
