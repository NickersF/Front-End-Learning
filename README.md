# Front-End-Learning
A repository that contains various front-end learning projects. This serves as a space where I can keep common UI patterns and templates which I can re-use and modify in the future. 

## Some notes on formatting:

* **File & folder naming conventions:**
Use underscores "_" between file names. Since the GitHub repository name forces *kebab-style* for the repository root folder. All sub folders will follow underscore style. File names will use underscores across all types.

* **Variable names:** will use camelCase.
* **Functions:** will use camelCase.
* **CSS class rules:** will use kebab-case.
* **SASS variables:** will use kebab-case.
* **HTML id's:** will use camelCase.
* **Image names:** will use underscore case.

## Pricing Grid Template:
A basic pricing grid based on the flexbox layout engine.
* The file **pricing_grid_template.html** contains a single product option in the pricing grid. A pricing grid can have many product options.
* The file **pricing_grid_preview.html** will show what many product options looks like in the browser.
